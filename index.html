      <p><em>Mechanical Engineering Graduate from the University of Oklahoma</em></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>I graduated from the <a href="https://www.ou.edu/" target="_blank">University of Oklahoma</a> in May of 2021 with
        my bachelor's in mechanical engineering. Since then I have worked
        as a process engineering intern for the United States Air Force
        at Tinker AFB and as a low voltage technician for Live Smart Automation
        in Denver, Colorado. I am currently searching for a new position, as
        well taking The Complete 2022 Web Developement Bootcamp course on
        Udemy in an effort to learn web developement and hopefully turn it into
        a career. It is very compatible with remote work and gig work, and is
        also well paid and an in-demand field that seems more comatible with my
        desired lifestyle than an engineering role.
